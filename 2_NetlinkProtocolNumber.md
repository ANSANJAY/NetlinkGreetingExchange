### 📖 **Understanding Netlink Protocol Number**

Diving into the intricate details of the Netlink protocol number, we aim to grasp its significance in the context of the Linux kernel. Let's begin!

---

#### **1. Introduction to Netlink Protocol Number 🧐**

- Within the Linux kernel, various subsystems coexist, and they all need to communicate with user space applications.
  
- A pertinent question arises: **How does an application determine which Linux kernel subsystem it wishes to interact with?** 🤔

- The answer lies in the **Netlink protocol number**. This is a unique ID assigned to every Linux kernel subsystem.

---

#### **2. Purpose of the Netlink Protocol Number 🎯**

- Each Linux kernel subsystem is distinguished by a unique Netlink protocol number.
  
- User space applications utilize this number to specify their desired communication partner among the various Netlink subsystems.

---

#### **3. Existing and Reserved Protocol Numbers 📜**

- Several Netlink protocol numbers have been pre-reserved for existing kernel subsystems.
  
- For instance, the entire routing infrastructure and the TCP/IP stack in the Linux kernel are allocated a protocol number: **zero**.
  
- These assignments can be found in the file: `Linux/netlink.h`.

---

#### **4. Some Noteworthy Protocol Numbers 🔢**

- The TCP/IP stack and routing infrastructure are linked with the Netlink protocol number `Netlink route`, which is **zero**.
  
- The firewall infrastructure in the Linux kernel bears the number **three**.
  
- There's an upper limit: **32**. This is the maximum Netlink protocol number available. Extending beyond this requires changing this limit.

---

#### **5. Our Netlink Project & Protocol Number Selection 🚀**

- In our endeavor, we will deploy a new Linux kernel module. This module will act as a new kernel subsystem.
  
- The communication between applications and this new kernel subsystem will use the unused Netlink protocol number: **31**.

### 🤔 **Interview Questions on Netlink Protocol Number**

**Q1:** What is the primary function of a Netlink protocol number in the Linux kernel?

> **Answer:** The Netlink protocol number serves as a unique ID for each Linux kernel subsystem, enabling user space applications to determine and communicate with their desired subsystem.

**Q2:** Where can one find the list of existing Netlink protocol numbers and their respective kernel subsystems?

> **Answer:** The list is available in the file `Linux/netlink.h`, which contains the Netlink protocol numbers assigned to various kernel subsystems.

**Q3:** Which Netlink protocol number is assigned to the TCP/IP stack and the routing infrastructure in the Linux kernel?

> **Answer:** The TCP/IP stack and routing infrastructure are allocated the Netlink protocol number `Netlink route`, which is **zero**.

**Q4:** What's the maximum permissible value for a Netlink protocol number, and what happens if we wish to exceed this limit?

> **Answer:** The upper limit for a Netlink protocol number is **32**. To utilize a number beyond this limit, one would need to modify this constraint in the kernel configuration.

**Q5:** In our project, which Netlink protocol number will our new kernel subsystem utilize?

> **Answer:** In our project, the new kernel subsystem will communicate using the Netlink protocol number **31**.
