### 📖 **Netlink Communication: Basic Overview**

In this section, we dive deep into the fundamentals of netlink communication between the user space and kernel space. Here's a comprehensive guide on the subject.

---

#### **1. Introduction to Netlink Communication 🌍**

- Netlink communication revolves around two main components:
  - **User Space Program**: This is where our applications run.
  - **Linux Kernel Space Program**: This handles core OS operations.
  
- Both of these are separate entities. They are written, compiled, and run independently.

---

#### **2. Purpose of Our Basic Netlink Program 🎯**

- We aim to set up a basic bidirectional communication system between the user space and our custom Linux kernel module.
- Our initial program is simple: both the user space application and the Linux kernel module will exchange basic greetings like "Hello, how are you?"

#### **3. Writing the Linux Kernel Module for Netlink Communication 📝**

Here are the primary steps involved:

1. **Initialization & Cleanup Functions**:
   - As with all Linux kernel modules, we'll begin by registering the `init` (initialization) and `cleanup` (exit) functions.
   
2. **Netlink Kernel Configuration**:
   - This is a special data structure provided by the Linux kernel.
   - Its main use will be discussed in-depth when we explore the code.
   
3. **Creating the Netlink Socket**:
   - This socket is crucial for facilitating communication.
   
4. **Destruction of Netlink Socket**:
   - Essential for freeing up resources occupied by the netlink socket when it's no longer needed or when the module is removed from the kernel.
   
5. **Processing Messages**:
   - The kernel module will:
     - Receive messages from the user space.
     - Process these messages.
     - Send a response back to the user space application.

#### **4. Exploring New APIs and Functions 🕵️‍♂️**

- Throughout our coding journey, we'll come across several new APIs and functions.
- These will be discussed in detail, explaining their significance and the reason for their inclusion in our code.

#### **5. Ready to Dive into Coding! 🚀**

Now that we have a solid foundation, it's time to jump into the coding aspect!

### 🤔 **Interview Questions on Netlink Communication**

**Q1:** What are the main components involved in netlink communication? 

> **Answer:** The two primary components in netlink communication are the User Space Program and the Linux Kernel Space Program.

**Q2:** Why is the Netlink Kernel Configuration data structure essential in our Linux kernel module for netlink communication?

> **Answer:** The Netlink Kernel Configuration is a special data structure provided by the Linux kernel. It plays a vital role in setting up and configuring netlink communication, which we'll discuss in-depth while reviewing the code.

**Q3:** What is the main purpose of the `init` and `cleanup` functions in a Linux kernel module?

> **Answer:** In a Linux kernel module, the `init` function is used for initialization when the module is loaded, and the `cleanup` function is used for cleanup tasks when the module is removed.

**Q4:** What is the basic message exchange in our initial netlink program?

> **Answer:** In our initial program, both the user space application and the Linux kernel module will simply exchange greetings like "Hello, how are you?"

**Q5:** Why is it essential to free up the resources occupied by the netlink socket?

> **Answer:** It's crucial to free up these resources to ensure efficient memory management and avoid potential memory leaks, especially when the kernel module is removed or is no longer needed.
